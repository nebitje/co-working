        <h2>History of Audi</h2>
        <p>
            Audi is a German automobile manufacturer that has a rich history dating back to the late 19th century. Here's a brief overview of the key milestones in Audi's history:

            Foundation and Early Years (1885-1932):
            
            The roots of Audi can be traced back to the late 19th century when August Horch founded his first car company, August Horch & Cie. Motorwagenwerke AG, in 1899.
            Due to trademark issues with the name "Horch," Horch had to choose a new name for his second car company. In 1909, he formed a new company and chose the name "Audi," which is a Latin translation of his last name, meaning "hear" or "listen."
            In 1932, Audi, DKW, Horch, and Wanderer merged to form Auto Union. The famous four interlinked rings logo represents the four founding companies.
            Auto Union Era (1932-1945):
            
            During this period, Auto Union produced a range of vehicles, including racing cars that dominated motorsports. The Silver Arrows, as the racing cars were known, achieved considerable success in Grand Prix racing.
            World War II disrupted production, and Auto Union's facilities were repurposed for war efforts.
            Post-War Rebuilding (1945-1960s):
            
            After the war, the Auto Union facilities were located in what became East Germany. The company ceased to exist in its previous form.
            In West Germany, a new Auto Union emerged, and the Ingolstadt plant started producing motorcycles and small cars.
            Volkswagen acquired Auto Union in 1964, leading to the formation of Audi NSU Auto Union AG.
            Audi Brand Revival (1960s-1980s):
            
            Audi gained recognition for its innovative and technologically advanced vehicles during this period.
            The Audi 100, introduced in 1968, showcased the brand's commitment to engineering and design.
            Audi introduced the quattro all-wheel-drive system in 1980, revolutionizing the automotive industry.
            Modern Era (1990s-Present):
            
            In the 1990s, Audi expanded its product line and gained a reputation for producing luxury and high-performance vehicles.
            The company became a part of the Volkswagen Group in 1966, and this association allowed Audi to benefit from shared technologies and resources.
            Audi's lineup includes a wide range of models, from compact cars to SUVs and high-performance sports cars.

            Throughout its history, Audi has been known for its commitment to innovation, quality engineering, and a strong presence in motorsports. 
            The brand has become synonymous with luxury and performance in the automotive industry.
